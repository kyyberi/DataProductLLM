# Customer requirements as input

We will record online discussion with at least one more or less actual customer case, someone who needs a data products. Ideally we should get more cases, but that might be the second phase as well. 

## AI agent transcription

We will use AI driven transcription and summary tool like fireflies AI. Those tools are invited to for example a Zoom meeting as participants and stay silent while recording data from the dialog. The tools can also create summaries and action points after the session. We will most likely use raw transcription as input first and test also combination of raw material and AI generated summary. 

# Questions to be presented in discussion

In order to get needed data, we need to ask some targeted questions just like in any business negotation and discussions. Some answers most likely are answered very thoroughly, some partially and in some cases not at all. That is the reality. The solution must be able to act on imperfect data as input. Thus generative AI is the solution here, rather than purely coded and predefined logic. 

We know that as a result we want 3 machine-readable artefacts that are generated and content matches the customer needs expressed in natural language. The 3 artefacts are: 

- Data Product Description, 
- Data Contract, and 
- Commercial Agreement. 

This is the framework against which the questions are framed. 

## Question 1: Purpose of the data product

**Aim:**  The aim is to figure out what is the value customer wants to create. Aim is to figure out the value created in numbers so that we can apply value-based selling and set the data product pricing. Also from the input we can generate good name and description for the data product.  

**Expected information nuggets:**

- What is the context in which data product is used? Can you describe the use case or project that requires this data? decision-making or operations?
- Get the customer to explain the value created with this data product
- Can you estimate the value. Is this expected to save costs? How much? Perhaps increase sales of another product? Reduce risks? 

**Questions to use in meeting:**

- Who do you see as the typical users of the data product? Perhaps analysts or something else? 
- Can you explain what is the expected value created with the data product? 
- What kind of gap you aim to fill in with this data product? 
- What is the financial value of solving this problem or meeting this need as savings, increased sales or risk reduction? 

## Question 2: What is the content? 

**Aim:** The aim is to figure out what kind of data is needed to create the value described by the customer. Also figure out compliance requirements for data.  

**Expected information nuggets:**

- Domains of data if multiple
- Data needs as fields. Example customer details such as address, phone number, country, etc. 

**Questions to use in meeting:**

- What specific data points or types of data are you looking for?
- Are there any specific formats or structures you require the data in?
- In what format do you need the data (e.g., CSV, API, etc.)?
- Are there specific standards, regulatory requirements or benchmarks the data must meet?

## Question 3: Data Quality and SLA

**Aim:**  The aim is to figure out the data quality requirements and SLA levels that fulfill customer needs. As combination of this and Question 2 we can generate the "as code" DQ and SLA rules. 

**Expected information nuggets:**

- DQ dimensions and level for those
- SLA level

**Questions to use in meeting:**

- What level of data accuracy and reliability do you require?
- How frequently should the data be updated or refreshed?
- What is your tolerance for data latency?
- Any other data quality dimensions that require attention? 
- Do you have specific service-level agreements (SLAs) in mind for data delivery and support? Channels and support hours? 


## Question 4: Pricing

**Aim:**  The aim is to figure out what kind of pricing model fits in the case. With help of this we can set the pricing plan.  

**Expected information nuggets:**

- ....
- ....

**Questions to use in meeting:**

- What budget do you have allocated for data acquisition?
- Are you open to a subscription model, one-time purchase, or a usage-based pricing model?
- freemium model to test the data first?
