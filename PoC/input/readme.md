# Customer requirements as input

We will record online discussion with at least one more or less actual customer case, someone who needs a data products. Ideally we should get more cases, but that might be the second phase as well. 

## AI agent transcription

We will use AI driven transcription and summary tool like fireflies AI. Those tools are invited to for example a Zoom meeting as participants and stay silent while recording data from the dialog. The tools can also create summaries and action points after the session. We will most likely use raw transcription as input first and test also combination of raw material and AI generated summary. 

## Questions to be presented in discussion

In order to get needed data, we need to ask some targeted questions just like in any business negotation and discussions. Some answers most likely are answered very thoroughly, some partially and in some cases not at all. That is the reality. The solution must be able to act on imperfect data as input. Thus generative AI is the solution here, rather than purely coded and predefined logic. 

We know that as a result we want 3 machine-readable artefacts that are generated and content matches the customer needs expressed in natural language. The 3 artefacts are: Data Product Description, Data Contract, and Commercial Agreement. This is the framework against which the questions are framed.
