# Prompts used

We use vanilla ChatGPT 4o and following prompts.

## Prompt 1: Capture customer needs from Fireflies data

This prompt captures the customer needs from fileflies recorded transripts (prefereably we have 3 cases) and summary it creates. 
The questions used in the customer interview are structured, but always the customer is not able to answer to all, at least not in the first attempt. Thus it is expected that the process has to be iterative and new interview happens after each time we have generated the outcomes: data product spec, data contract and commercial agreement.
