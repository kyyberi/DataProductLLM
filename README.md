# DataProduct LLM
Experimental Data Product LLM framework. The aim is to build a reference implementation of something that can be described as follows: 


"Modern data product governance, built upon nimble standards that apply Everything as Code to SLA, Data Quality, and Pricing plans. This model draws influence from the "terraforming" concept and principles of Infrastructure as Code. These concepts, often applied to data management, are extended to the business layer, which consists of data products, contracts, and commercial agreements."
